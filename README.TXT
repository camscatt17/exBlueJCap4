Purpose of project: To provide an illustration of the use of arrays.
How to start this project: Create a LogAnalyzer object.

The LogfileReader expects to read a file, weblog.txt,
containing lines of data in the format:

    year month day hour minute

month values are in the range 1-12 and day values in the range 1-31. If
the sample file cannot be found, the reader will create some simulated
data.
